## Privacy Policy

### Introduction
Reparto Manager is a lightweight and efficient application designed for delivery companies to optimize the management of orders based on locations, prices, and order priorities. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect the information you provide while using Reparto Manager. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to safeguarding your personal data.

### Information We Collect
When using Reparto Manager, the following information is collected and stored locally on the device:

Customer Information: Name, phone number, email address, and postal code.
Order Information: Order distance, price, and other details necessary for optimizing deliveries.
Geolocation Data: Postal codes and geographic data related to the delivery locations, visualized on the Google Maps interface.
### How We Use Your Information
We use the information collected for the following purposes:

Order Management: To automate the selection and optimization of delivery orders based on customer proximity, order price, and other criteria.
Communication: To allow delivery personnel to call or email customers directly via the app.
Route Optimization: To display delivery routes and groups of orders based on postal codes using Google Maps.
Database Operations: To perform SQL queries and manage the local SQLite database effectively, including retrieving, updating, and deleting order records.
### Data Storage and Security
All data collected and processed by Reparto Manager is stored locally on the owner’s device (i.e., the phone or tablet where the app is installed). There is no cloud storage or external server involved in storing customer or order information. This ensures that your data remains private and under your direct control.

We implement appropriate security measures to protect the local SQLite database and prevent unauthorized access to your data. However, it is important to note that securing access to the device itself (e.g., by setting up passwords, encryption, or other safeguards) is the responsibility of the user.

### Third-Party Services
Reparto Manager uses the following third-party services:

Google Maps API: Utilized for displaying geographic data such as delivery routes and order locations on the map.
Please refer to the Google Maps Privacy Policy for more details about how Google handles your data.

### Data Retention
Since all data is stored locally on your device, it will remain there until you delete the app or manually remove the information. Reparto Manager does not store any data on external servers, meaning your data will not be transferred to or backed up by external services unless you initiate it through device-specific backup solutions (e.g., Google Drive or iCloud).

### User Rights
As the owner of the device, you have full control over the data stored within Reparto Manager, including the following rights:

Access: You can view all the personal data stored on your device through the app’s interface.
Correction: You can update or correct any inaccurate information.
Deletion: You may delete customer or order data at any time from within the app.
Because the data is stored only on your device, any actions regarding data management (such as deletion or modification) must be performed directly on your phone or tablet.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be communicated within the application, and continued use of Reparto Manager after such changes will signify your acceptance of the revised policy.
